### App Demo
[Click here](https://youtu.be/gH5yKOluaVU) for a link to the demo of my app.

### Some important information

1. **This code is not complete**. I'm still trying to resolve an active issue with the code (where one of the buttons won't update as its state changes), but other than that, it should be up and running as expected.
2. In order to run this code on an emulator, you will need to first install Flutter. The instructions can be found [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install). I recommend following through the [next page](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/editor) to set up Dart and Flutter for your editor as well.
3. All the important code pieces for this app lies in the [lib](https://github.com/melabolic/flower_explorer/tree/master/lib) folder, so don't concern yourself too much with any of the other folders.
4. As of now, Firestore support of my app is only configured for Android devices. Please test the code using an Android Simulator.

### Running the app
`Important: In order to run the app, you would first need to have installed Flutter on your device. Check the instructions in bullet point two in the above section.`

Once you have Flutter configured and set up for your device, running the app is as simple as follows:
1. Start by cloning the entire repo into your own disk.
2. Boot up your editor of choice and open the folder for this project.
3. Locate the toolbar up on top and select the emulator you've created to run the app.
4. To run the app, click on the run button in the toolbar, or invoke the menu item `Run > Run`.
